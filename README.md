## Stationary
### Project 2
#### CS 491 - Intro to Game Development
#### Team Members: Alex, Andrew, Gale, John, Josue

## Important Notes

- For the smoke, it needs to be **above** the floor of the station &mdash; the behavior of the smoke does not behave as expected otherwise (everything in `Fire` scene is a child of some game object with a modified `Y` position)

- For the water hose (fire extinguisher), the initial shape needs to be changed from `sphere` to `cone` and the `Speed Modifier` under `Velocity over Lifetime` needs to be changed to some higher number ("weak" spray otherwise)
